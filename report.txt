Project Report: Flower Classification and Size Prediction using Object Detection
Abstract
The aim of this project is to develop a robust deep learning model that can classify images of flowers into different categories and predict their sizes using object detection techniques. The report presents the detailed methodology, implementation, and evaluation of the models. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model architecture design, model training, and performance evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in accurately classifying flower species and predicting their sizes based on bounding box areas.
